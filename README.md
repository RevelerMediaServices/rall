This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


## ReactJS and React Native Learn List
> Rall is intended to be a gathering of ReactJS and React Native **free** learning resources.  Although there are other resources for this information, Rall hopes to keep information current and relevant by adding tutorials, articles and other free media by date. Rall also includes a study sheet for ReactJS, React Native and related concepts.\

If one would like to contribute, one may submite an article or tutorial to [jwgravesfl@gmail.com](jwgravesfl@gmail.com).   


### Video Tutorials

### Study List
##### Primitive Types
> Immutable

undefined\
null(object)\
boolean\
number\
string\
symbol

#### Coercion
> Type conversion (or typecasting) means transfer of data from one data type to another. 

##### Explict/Implicit
> Implicit conversion happens when the compiler automatically assigns data types, but the source code can also\
explicitly require a conversion to take place.\
For example, given the instruction 5+2.0, the floating point 2.0 is implicitly typecasted into an integer, but given the instruction Number("0x11"), the string "0x11" is explicitly typecasted as the number 17.

- ● Which values are falsy?\
undefined\
null\
false\
+0, -0, NaN\
""

- Which values are truthy?\
{}\
[]\
Everything else\

##### Objects
> mutable and stored by reference\
almost everything except prmitives are objects

Explict/Implicit
##### Object Literal
> An object literal is a list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}). Do not use an object literal at the beginning of a statement. This will lead to an error or not behave as you expect, because the { will be interpreted as the beginning of a block.

##### Prototype Inheritance 
> All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.\
Date objects inherit from Date.prototype. Array objects inherit from Array.prototype. Person objects inherit from Person.prototype.\
The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:\
Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.
